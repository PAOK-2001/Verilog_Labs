Gumnut Core Verilog source files

This is a list of the files provided for the Verilog model of the Gumnut
core. The Verilog files are listed below in a correct order of
compilation.

gumnut-rtl.v

  module gumnut: Synthesizable RTL architecture in which instructions
  are executed one at a time over multiple clock cycles. The debug
  parameter turns on trace writes.

inst_mem.v

  module inst_mem: An instruction memory. Initializes the memory
  content from the file gasm_text.dat. Generate the file using Gasm -m.

data_mem.v

  module data_mem: A data memory. Initializes the memory content from
  the file gasm_data.dat. Generate the file using Gasm -m.

gumnut_with_mem.v

  module gumnut_with_mem: A module for a subsystem comprising a Gumnut
  core and instructions and data memories. The debug parameter is
  passed down to the Gumnut core.

gumnut_system.v

  module gumnut_system: A template module for a top-level system. Add
  ports for off-chip I/O, plus internal nets and instances to connect
  to the embedded Gumnut core with memories.

test.v

  module text: A module for a simulation testbench comprising a Gumnut
  with memories, clock and interrupt generators, and a bus-functional
  I/O controller.

test1A.gsm
test1B.gsm
test2.gsm
test3.gsm
test4A.gsm
test4B.gsm
test5.gsm

  A suite of test programs that exercise various aspects of the Gumnut
  core instruction set.
